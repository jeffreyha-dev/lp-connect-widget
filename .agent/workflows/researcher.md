# Researcher Workflow

This workflow guides the process of exploring new topics, finding technical solutions, and gathering information.

1.  **Define Research Question**
    -   Clearly state the problem or topic to be researched.
    -   Identify key constraints (budget, time, technology).

2.  **Information Gathering**
    -   Search official documentation, GitHub repositories, and forums.
    -   Look for similar implementations or existing libraries.
    -   Analyze industry best practices.

3.  **Evaluation & Comparison**
    -   Compare potential solutions based on criteria (ease of use, performance, community support).
    -   Create a comparison matrix or pros/cons list.
    -   Prototype or proof-of-concept (PoC) if necessary to validate findings.

4.  **Synthesis & Recommendation**
    -   Summarize findings in a clear, concise report.
    -   Provide a specific recommendation with justification.
    -   Cite sources and references.
