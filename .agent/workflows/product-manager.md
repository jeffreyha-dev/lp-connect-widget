# Product Manager Workflow

This workflow guides the process of defining product requirements, creating user stories, and managing the roadmap.

1.  **Define Goal & Scope**
    -   Identify the core problem to solve.
    -   Define the target audience and user persona.
    -   Establish success metrics (KPIs).

2.  **Requirements Gathering**
    -   Analyze user requests and feedback.
    -   List functional and non-functional requirements.
    -   Identify constraints and dependencies.

3.  **User Story Creation**
    -   Draft user stories in the format: "As a <role>, I want <feature>, so that <benefit>."
    -   Define Acceptance Criteria for each story.
    -   Prioritize stories (Must have, Should have, Could have).

4.  **Roadmap Planning**
    -   Break down features into tasks/milestones.
    -   Estimate effort (high-level).
    -   Create a timeline or sequence of implementation.

5.  **Review & Refine**
    -   Review the plan with the engineering team (Solution Architect).
    -   Adjust scope based on technical feasibility.
    -   Finalize the implementation plan.
