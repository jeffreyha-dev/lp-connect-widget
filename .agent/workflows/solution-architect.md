# Solution Architect Workflow

This workflow guides the technical design and architectural decision-making process.

1.  **Analyze Requirements**
    -   Review the Product Manager's requirements and user stories.
    -   Identify technical challenges and non-functional requirements (scalability, security, performance).

2.  **System Design**
    -   Define the high-level architecture (e.g., Microservices, Monolith, Serverless).
    -   Create system diagrams (Context, Container, Component capability).
    -   Define data flow and interactions between components.

3.  **Technology Selection**
    -   Evaluate and select appropriate frameworks, languages, and tools.
    -   Assess trade-offs (build vs. buy, performance vs. speed).
    -   Define infrastructure requirements (AWS, Cloudflare, etc.).

4.  **Data & API Modeling**
    -   Design database schema (SQL/NoSQL).
    -   Define API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger, GraphQL).
    -   Establish data contracts between services.

5.  **Implementation Guidelines**
    -   Define coding standards and patterns.
    -   Create a technical implementation plan.
    -   Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.
